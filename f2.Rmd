This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data<-diamonds
data2 <- data %>% slice(-c(301:53940))

diamond.function <- function(color1,facet2="NULL"){
  plt2<-ggplot(data = data2, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point(col = color1) + stat_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red") + labs(x = "Carat", y = "Price", title = "ScatterPlot of Dimond Weight (carat) and Price (price)")
  if(!facet2=="NULL"){
    return(plt2 + facet_grid(color~.))
  }
  return(plt2)
}

diamond.function("purple")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
